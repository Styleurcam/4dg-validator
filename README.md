# 4dg-validator
This is a quick python program to validate 4D Golf level files  

If you do not want spoilers for the game, do not read the code  

to run the program, execute this command in a terminal, replacing `PATH_TO_Main.py` and `PATH_TO_LEVEL_FILE` with the appropriate paths  
```py PATH_TO_Main.py PATH_TO_LEVEL_FILE```
